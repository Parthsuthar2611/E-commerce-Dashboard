🛒 Project Title 
📦 E‑commerce Pulse: Power BI E‑Commerce Sales Dashboard
An interactive dashboard that visualizes online sales performance—tracking revenue, profits, product categories, customer behavior, and regional trends for data-driven E‑commerce management.

🎯 Purpose
The E‑commerce Pulse Dashboard is built in Power BI to provide an intuitive analytical interface that helps monitor sales, profit margins, and customer behavior. Designed for E‑commerce store owners and data analysts, this dashboard enables quick decision-making across regions, categories, and payment methods.

⚙️ Tech Stack
📊Power BI Desktop – For building and publishing the dashboard

📂Power Query – Cleans and transforms data from CSV inputs into structured tables

🧠DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculates KPIs (sales total, profit, average order value, quantity sold) and dynamic measures

📝Data Modeling – Relationships between Orders, Products, Customers, Payment Modes, and Region tables

📁.pbix File Format – Power BI project file format for development and sharing

🗂️ Data Source
Source: CSV files used and shared as part of Rishabh Mishra’s E‑commerce dashboard tutorial 

Typical dataset includes:

Orders.csv – Contains order-level data: Order ID, Date, Customer, Category, Product, Quantity, Sales, Profit, Payment Mode, State/Region, etc.

Products.csv (or Details.csv) – Product metadata: names, categories, subcategories, prices

Cleaned and prepped via Power Query for meaningful visualization and analysis.

🌟 Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
E‑commerce businesses need to track and optimize online sales performance across multiple dimensions. Without visuals, raw data makes it hard to identify trends in sales, profit margins, product category performance, and customer trends.

Key questions addressed:

Which product categories drive the most revenue?

How do profits vary by region or month?

What payment methods are most popular—and profitable?

Who are the top customers or best-selling states?

• Goal of the Dashboard
Provide a unified dashboard that:

➵Summarizes sales, profits, and customer behavior via KPIs

➵Enables dynamic filtering by category, region, payment mode

➵Identifies top-performing categories, products, and customers

➵Tracks profit trends and seasonal variations

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
